## Abstract
Friction and wear of sliding surfaces are responsible for important energy losses and negative environmental effects. The use of environmentally friendly and cost-effective protic ionic liquids as neat lubricants and lubricant additives has the potential to increase the efficiency and durability of mechanical components without increasing the environmental damage. In this work, three halogen-free protic ionic liquids with increasing extent of ionicity, 2-hydroxyethylammonium 2-ethylhexanoate, 2-hydroxymethylammonium 2-ethylhexancate, and 2-hydroxydimethylammonium 2-ethylhexanoate, were synthesized and studied as neat lubricants and additives to a biodegradable oil in a steelâ€“steel contact. The results show that the use of any protic ionic liquid as a neat lubricant or lubricant additive reduced friction and wear with respect to the biodegradable oil. The ionic liquid with the lowest ionicity reached the highest wear reduction. The one possessing the highest ionicity presented the poorest friction and wear behaviors as a neat lubricant, probably due to the more ionic nature of this liquid, which promoted tribocorrosion reactions on the steel surface. This ionic liquid performed better as an additive, showing that a small addition of this liquid in a biodegradable oil is enough to form protective layers on steel surfaces. However, it is not enough to accelerate the wear process with detrimental tribocorrosion reac
